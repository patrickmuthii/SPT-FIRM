                At <span class="font-semibold">SPT Capital</span>, market analysis is more than chart-watching —
                it is the disciplined process of understanding the forces that drive financial markets at their core.
                Our approach blends <span class="font-semibold">macro fundamentals, institutional positioning,
                    supply–demand dynamics,
                    and structured risk management</span> to anticipate opportunities rather than react to noise.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                At <span class="font-semibold">SPT Capital</span>, gold is the cornerstone of our strategy.
                Unlike speculative traders who chase short-term volatility, we approach XAU/USD with a structured

            <!-- Bullet Points -->
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 text-gray-700">
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold">Macro Drivers:</span>
                    We closely monitor interest rate policies, inflation trends, and central bank activity
                    (especially the U.S. Federal Reserve and emerging-market central banks) as they remain
                    primary forces shaping gold demand.

                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold">Institutional Flows:</span>
                    By analyzing futures positioning, ETF flows, and order-book imbalances, we track how large players
                    accumulate or distribute positions — often before retail markets react.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold">Supply & Demand Dynamics:</span>
                    We study mining output, geopolitical disruptions, and jewelry demand across major economies like
                    China and India to anticipate fundamental supply shocks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold">Risk Management Lens:</span>
                    Gold serves as a global hedge. We integrate it into disciplined trading strategies that balance
                    growth with capital preservation, ensuring that investor funds are not exposed recklessly.
                </li>

            <!-- Closing Statement -->
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                Our goal is not simply to trade gold — it is to anticipate the structural shifts driving its price
                cycles
                and align our strategies with those moves.
